  <h1>Frame 2</h1>
  <h2>Invited Third</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">üïØ The Reality Spark</div>
    <p>It started as a fantasy. They were magnetic‚Äîher curls, his calm. A couple so aligned, they moved like music. You felt it in the shared laughter, the occasional eye contact, the way the night danced between all of you without needing words.</p>

    <p>But then she turned. And he smiled. And there was another‚Äîsomeone new. Someone waiting. And you realized: you weren‚Äôt crashing their story.</p>

    <p>You were being handed a verse.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">üî• The Burn</div>
    <p>Their friend‚Äîsoft eyes, wicked hips, the kind of grin that pulls honesty out of you‚Äîwas exactly your tempo. She took your hand on the dance floor before you could second-guess a thing.</p>

    <p>The couple stayed close. Not as shadows. As harmony. He watched you dip her. She bit your shoulder and caught their gaze over yours. It wasn‚Äôt just permission. It was orchestration.</p>

    <p>In the hotel room later, it wasn‚Äôt just sex. It was rhythm. Reverence. You fucked like you were already known.</p>

    <p>They didn‚Äôt touch you‚Äîbut they *did*. She whispered to them what you were doing to her. They praised you with eyes and smiles and breath held from the other bed. And all of you were *lit*, alive in the knowing.</p>

    <p>By morning, you weren‚Äôt just seen. You were remembered.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">‚úç The Residue</div>
    <p>You don‚Äôt always get to feel that kind of welcome. That kind of rhythm. Where sexuality doesn‚Äôt erase friendship, it deepens it. Where eyes linger with warmth instead of weight.</p>

    <p>You still think about the way their friend curled into your side, and the way the couple wrapped her in praise while glancing at you like you were art.</p>

    <p>You didn‚Äôt steal the spotlight.<br />
    You joined the dance.<br />
    And you didn‚Äôt leave empty.<br />
    You left *fed*.</p>
  </div>
